# Final Project

**Due: Thursday, May 3, 2018, 3 p.m.**

As noted in the syllabus, the final project is a stand-alone interactive data visualization project.

This project is worth **50 points.**

## Rubric

At least **three (3)** charts are expected to be hand-coded (no copied-and-pasted code from course notes, exercise solutions, etc.). Descriptions should include information about the data being presented (what are you trying to say through the chart without giving the full detail away).

A one-page template (`index.html`) and style sheet (`style.css`) have been created for your convenience, but you are welcome to create your own design. Keep your files organized in a directory structure (i.e. `data` for your data files, `js` for your d3, lodash libraries and scripts, etc.).


## Assessment

The following requirements should be met to earn the associated points:

- **5 points**

This accounts for your project proposal submission and meeting. The proposal itself is worth 2.5 points. The meeting is another 2.5 points. Late submissions or missed meetings earn a zero.


### Remaining Point Breakdown

- **45 points**

The project could be published as-is. The code properly uses d3 (and lodash if necessary) and is original. The text is thorough and explains the purpose of the visualizations, both individually and cohesively. Charts are properly labeled. Labels are readable in all cases. Interactive features are used appropriately. Files are organized. Copy is clean. Design is consistent.

- **40 points**

The project could be published with 1-2 adjustments. The code is original, but does not always deviate from course notes, previously submitted portfolio examples or exercise solutions. Descriptions may require more explanations. Labels may need adjustments for readability. Interactive features are inappropriately used. Files may require organization. Copy requires minimal editing. Design elements needs subtle adjustments.

- **35 points**

Project does not meet minimum chart requirements. The project needs significant edits. Code relies significantly on examples provided during the semester. Labels are missing or incomplete. Interactive features are broken. Descriptions are minimal. Files are not organized. Copy requires editing. Design needs improvement. Professional presentation is ill-advised.

- **30 points**

Project does not meet minimum requirements and/or heavy use of examples provided during the semester. Descriptions are minimal or non-existent. Copy needs significant re-working/editing. Design elements are inconsistent.

- **25 points**

Project is submitted but wholly incomplete.

- **0 points**

Project is not submitted.



## Submission

You are required to post your final project to GitHub. Please create this in a repository separate from all other work named `data-viz-final`.

**Email Prof. Brown with a link to your exercise portfolio no later than Friday, May 3, 2019, Noon.**

The submission deadline for this project is a *hard deadline.* Projects submitted past **Friday, May 3, 2018 at 3 p.m.** will receive a 10-point deduction per day the project is late.

Do not wait until the last minute to email your URL.


## Academic Dishonesty & Plagiarism

So there is absolutely no confusion:

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the University of Miami Honor Code. Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated. Plagiarism is the taking of someone else's words, work, or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts.

Use of copyrighted content must have written approval from the original author and be properly sourced. Files may not be 'hot linked'. Copying or reproduction of web site design and/or source code will be considered an act of plagiarism.

Students are not permitted to use programs which generate or format web pages using a graphical user interface (i.e. Adobe Dreamweaver, WordPress, etc.).

**Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed above and in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.**

Simply put, any incidents of academic dishonesty will cause you to fail this course.


**Good luck!**
